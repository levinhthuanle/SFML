## 1. Introduction

The Course Management System is a platform for educational purposes. There will be 2 types of users: Students and Academic Staffs. The Academic Staffs can do lots of works including create a school year, semester, add a course, ... while students can view their courses and score through this platform.

## 2. Usage
You have to config the paths to the SFML Libs in order to run our application or testing. Watch the video below to know how to do it (You don't have to download the SFML Libs because we have already done it, and put in inside the SFML_Libs)
